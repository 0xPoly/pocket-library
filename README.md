Pocket Library
==============
Share books from anywhere! Pocket Library is a lightweight portable library designed to run on
OpenWrt devices. If you're reading this now, PL is still not ready for use. Check back in a
week or so. :)

###Compatability
Pocket Library is designed for the TP-Link TRM3020, and flashable images are available for an
easy installation. Scripts for installation on other OpenWrt devices are also available, but
haven't been tested yet.
